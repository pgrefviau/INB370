----- Known bugs -----

1- State change not originally trigerred for one of the UI's sliders. This means that the value in the corresponding box will not show up until the user manually changes the slider position, though the correct value is actually present and will get passed to the simulation when launched.

----- Main method -----

The main method is stil contained in SimulationRunner in the asgn2Simulators package. To run it from a commande line (from the CarParkSimulator directory), simply input "java -classpath bin;jcommon-1.0.21.jar;jfreechart-1.0.17.jar asgn2Simulators.SimulationRunner" where "java" is the location of your JRE. Make sure that the librairies  "jcommon-1.0.21.jar" and "freechart-1.0.17.jar" are in the current directory. 

To add arguments, just input the 10 required values after the previously mentionned instruction, with a space between each. Use the following order :

maxCarSpaces maxSmallCarSpaces maxMotorCycleSpaces maxQueueSize seed carProb smallCarProb mcProb	meanStay sdStay

Hit enter to launch the program.

----- Other -----

Both equals and hashCode methods have been overidden for the vehicule class. Email from Jim said it shouldn't be a problem.
