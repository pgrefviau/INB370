----- Known bugs -----

1- State change not originally trigerred for one of the UI's sliders. This means that the value in the corresponding box will not show up until the user manually changes the slider position, though the correct value is actually present and will get passed to the simulation when launched.

----- Main method -----

The main method is stil contained in SimulationRunner in the asgn2Simulators package. 

----- Extra -----

Both equals and hashCode methods have been overidden for the vehicule class. Email from Jim said it shouldn't be a problem.
